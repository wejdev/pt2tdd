Tower Breakers

Two players are playing a game of Tower Breakers! Player 1 always moves first, and both players always play optimally. The rules of the game are as follows:
Initially there are n towers.
Each tower is of height m.
The players move in alternating turns.
In each turn, a player can choose a tower of height x and reduce its height to y, where 1 ≤ y < x and y evenly divides x.
If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.
Given the values of n and m, determine which player will win. If the first player wins, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.

Example
n = 2
m = 6

There are 2 towers, each 6 units tall. Player 1 has a choice of two moves:
remove 3 pieces from a tower to leave 3 as 6 modulo 3 = 0
remove 5 pieces to leave 1

Let Player 1 remove 3. Now the towers are 3 and 6 units tall.

Player 2 matches the move. Now the towers are both 3 units tall.

Now Player 1 has only one move.

Player 1 removes 2 pieces leaving 1. Towers are 1 and 2 units tall.

Player 2 matches again. Towers are both 1 unit tall.

Player 1 has no move and loses. Return 2.

Function Description
Complete the towerBreakers function in the editor below.

towerBreakers has the following parameter(s):
int n: the number of towers
int m: the height of each tower

Returns
int: the winner of the game

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer t, the number of test cases.
Each of the next t lines describes a test case in the form of 2 space-separated integers, n and m.

Constraints
1 ≤ t ≤ 100
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6

Sample Input
2          t = 2
2 2        n = 2, m = 2
1 4        n = 1, m = 4

Sample Output
2
1

Explanation
We'll refer to player 1 as P1 and player 2 as P2.

In the first test case, P1 chooses one of the two towers and reduces it to 1. Then P2 reduces the remaining tower to a height of 1. As both towers now have height 1, P1 cannot make a move so P2 is the winner.

In the second test case, there is only one tower of height 4. P1 can reduce it to a height of either 1 or 2. P1 chooses 1 as both players always choose optimally. Because P2 has no possible move, P1 wins.

To deduce the general rule of who wins in this game:
If the number of towers (n) is odd, player 1 will always be able to leave an even number of towers at height 1 for player 2, which means player 1 will win because player 2 will always face an even number of towers with a height greater than 1 and will be forced to reduce one, leaving an odd number for player 1.
If the number of towers (n) is even, and the height (m) is greater than 1, player 1 will reduce one tower, and then player 2 can always mirror player 1's moves, ensuring that the towers' heights are always equal and eventually leaving player 1 with no moves.
If the height (m) is 1, no moves can be made, and player 2 wins by default because player 1 cannot make a move.
Thus, player 1 wins if n is odd or m is 1; otherwise, player 2 wins.
